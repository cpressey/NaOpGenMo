NaOpGenMo
=========

National Opera Generation Month, based on an idea that -- look, don't ask, you don't really want to know.  Suffice to say it is riffing on [NaNoGenMo](https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo-2014) which is itself riffing on [NaNoWriMo](nanowrimo.org).

The structure is very similar to NaNoGenMo, and therefore the following text is too, with apologies to @dariusk.

The Goal
--------

Spend the month of November* writing code that generates an opera which is 2.5+ hours long.

_*Yes, I fully realize that, as of this writing, November 2014 is half over.  2014's NaOpGenMo might only be half a "Mo" and the first official, full-size one might not be until next year, something like that.  Watch this space._

The Rules
---------

The only rule is that you share at least one opera, and also your source code, at the end.

The source code does not have to be licensed in a particular way, nor hosted on Github, just so long as you share it.

The "opera" is defined however you want.  It could be 50,000 beats of middle C played on a clarinet (or, if you are the sort of person for whom an opera must include singing, 50,000 chants of "Meow!" by a tenor.)  It could literally grab a random opera from <s>Project Brandenburg</s> The Internet Archive.  It doesn't matter, as long as it's at least two and a half hours long.

_Please try to respect copyright,_ especially in light of [the economics of Girl Talk](http://blog.priceonomics.com/post/47719281228/the-economics-of-girl-talk).  (tl;dr here be dragons.  Best to stick to source material that explicitly says "yes, you can re-use this" and credit it.)

This activity starts at TBD and ends at TBD.

How to Participate
------------------

NaOpGenMo will probably use NaNoGenMo's model: if you want to participate, open an issue on this repo, where you can declare your intent to participate, post ideas you have and updates on your progress, sample code or operatic excerpts, and so forth.  Feel free, also, to comment on other participants' issues.

Have fun!
